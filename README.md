# Stock prediction in python

This is a stock prediction program in python using LTSM(Long Short-term Memory)

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the
field of deep learning. 

LSTM is well suited for stock prediction due to its ability to store past information that is important,
and forget the information that is not important.

Description: This program uses an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing stock price of a corporation (Apple Inc.) using the past 60 day stock price.

# Happy coding!
